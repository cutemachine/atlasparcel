# AtlasParcel

Launch your own projects in no time with AtlasParcel.

This is a basic React app which includes some [Atlaskit](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/) components.


## Technologies Used

- [Babel—Next generation JavaScript](https://babeljs.io)
- [React—A JavaScript library for building user interfaces](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Atlaskit—Atlassian's official UI library](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/)
- [Parcel—Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler](https://parceljs.org)
- [Redux—Predictable state container for JavaScript apps](https://redux.js.org/)


## Getting Started

Just clone the project. Remove the old Git history. Then install the dependencies with `yarn`. When the installation has finished you can run the new app with `yarn start`. These are the steps in more detail:

    git clone https://github.com/cutemachine/atlasparcel.git
    cd atlasparcel
    rm -rf .git
    yarn
    yarn start

When the dev server started you can point your broswer to the URL given in the Terminal. Normally this is [localhost:1234](http:localhost:1234).


## Build

You can build the project with the `parcel` command. You can also use the NPM script set up in the `package.json` file.

    yarn build
